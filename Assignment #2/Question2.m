%Part a)
% This code takes the TwoDV code and inserts resistive contacts in the 
% geometry. All of the required plots are contained in this code
Contacts

%Part b)
% The mesh density versus inter-contact current is investigated by 
% increasing the mesh from 10 to 100
meshdensity

%Part c)
% The distance between contacts versus inter-contact current is investigated  
% by decreasing distance between the contacts from 73 um to 1 um
bottleneck

%Part d)
% The resistivity of the contacts was changed from 0.01 to 1 to investigate
% its impact
